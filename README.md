# Webdev-day3-work
This is a school task of A STAR Education Centre of Myanmar.
<br> <br>
In day 3, we learned data types and html / css basics <br>
in school. This is responsive flex guide web page <br>
practice made by Bhone Myat San also known as irom as <br>
his nick name.
<br> <br>
This flex guide webpage is responsive using @media. <br>

# Where did I learn about @media property?
I was going through coding videos by front-end developers
and met up with a Kevin Powell's CSS3 video about responsive
layouts and webpages. I learned about @media properties and 
its values through my self-study.
